#For this project I used SQL to query the Superstore database to get more information about prices, average rating, stock quantity.

#Show Superstore database starting with highest in value
SELECT * 
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price desc;

#Show the total amount each item sold 
SELECT SUM (price), item_name
FROM superstore
GROUP BY item_name;

#Show the average rating for Electronics

SELECT AVG (average_rating), item_name, category
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Electronics'
GROUP BY item_name;

#Show how many 'Slow Cookers' are in stock along with their price

SELECT item_name, stock_quantity
FROM superstore 
WHERE item_name = 'Slow Cooker'
